      <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations. The 22nd FIFA World Cup is taking place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022; it is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A] France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 final. At an estimated cost of over $220 billion,[2] it is the most expensive World Cup ever held; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost is $8 billion,[3] and other figures relate to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.</p>

      <p>The Croatia national football team (Croatian: Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija) represents Croatia in association football and is governed by the Croatian Football Federation (HNS). Sides were active during periods of political upheaval, representing sovereign entities such as the Banovina of Croatia from 1939 to 1941 or the Independent State of Croatia from 1941 to 1944. The team representing the Republic has played competitive matches since 1994 starting with the qualifying campaign for the UEFA Euro 1996.

          The team is colloquially referred to as Vatreni (Blazers) and Kockasti (Checkered Ones). They maintain sporting rivalries with Italy and Serbia, both of which have led to disruptive matches. Since becoming eligible to compete, Croatia has qualified for every UEFA Euro and FIFA World Cup tournament except for the UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In 1998, they competed in their first FIFA World Cup, finishing third place and including the tournament's top scorer, Davor Šuker. Twenty years later Croatia reached the 2018 World Cup Final with France, finishing second and including the tournament's best player, Luka Modrić.
          
          The team represents the second-smallest country by population and land mass to reach a World Cup Final, behind Uruguay and Netherlands respectively. At the FIFA World Cup, Croatia holds joint-records for most penalty shoot-outs played (2), most extra time period played (3) and most penalties saved in a match (3), among other records. They are one of three teams—along with Colombia and France—to be named FIFA Best Mover of the Year more than once, winning the awards in 1994 and 1998.[3][4] Croatia entered FIFA ranked 125th in 1994; they ascended to third place following their 1998 World Cup campaign. This marked the fastest, most volatile ascension in FIFA Ranking history.
